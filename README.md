#This report was made as part of investigation task that I performed in my uni.

#Background: Bob is suspected of engaging in illegal online activities. Prior intelligence reports are vague, conflicting and lacking sufficient detail. A warrant was issued and an officer was able to covertly access and perform a logical acquisition of Bob's computer. 
#You have been assigned the task of investigating Bob's computer to extract evidence and formulate a series of conclusions as to what crimes (if any), Bob was engaging in.

#Considering the size of the Forensic image, I only present the final report to demonstrate the techniques used to draw out the conclusion.
